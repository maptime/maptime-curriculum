# Maptime Curriculum

## What's this Repo?
This repo is the hub for connecting various materials from both within and outside of Maptime for the purpose of creating a curriculum to be used at Maptime or other educational institutions. 

## Lesson Guidelines
At Maptime, we don't want to just TELL people about maps, we want to give them an opportunity to get their hands dirty working with mapping technologies...all within about 60-90 minutes of classtime, with room for introductions at the beginning!

To make this happen, lessons should include each of the following:

* **Instructional content** like a presentation or video. This covers both conceptual and how-to explanations.
* **Activities** Are you learning about data layers today? Have students create data layers in CartoDB! Are you talking about basemaps? Create a basemap in Mapbox! What about working with old data formats like Shapefiles? Maybe try bringing them into QGIS! No matter what the content is, give your students an opportunity to actually DO something. If you're talking about more conceptual stuff, create an opportunity for discussion.

We call this showing-then-doing method the **Tick Tock Method**. Thanks, Omar Ureta!

## Curriculum & Lesson Development Method
Creating both a curriculum and lesson should follow a similar set of steps. 

**1. Identify Learning Objectives / Outcomes**
What is it that you want students to walk away with? Be as specific as you can!

**2. Outline**
Once you've identified what students need to know, create an outline of what to cover. If you're doing a lesson outline, it can be a good idea to include time estimates for each part. 

**3. Flesh out your outline with content**
Want to watch a video? Or do you want to create your own presentation? No matter what your preference is, once your outline is done, it's content time!

## Curriculum Documentation

For each lesson, create a markdown page within this repo. Right now we're focused on putting together **beginner lessons** and **organizational instruction**. Please put your markdown page in the appropriate folder (0_organizational and 1_beginner).

Each lesson page should include the following:

* Learning objectives
* Links to your content (video, presentation, other)
* Lesson outline

Happy teaching! And even happier learning :)
